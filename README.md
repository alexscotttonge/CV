I started work at the interface of social and environmental business nine years ago which took me from oil and gas plc’s to economic finance firms. I co-founded Power of Youth, a global network for early stage entrepreneurs in 2011 and stepped back 18 months ago to pursue my interest in tech and the circular economy.
