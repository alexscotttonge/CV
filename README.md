I've got over 10 years commercial experience from FTSE-100 plc's to boutique consultancy firms. In 2010 I started my own business, a global support agency for purpose-driven high growth entrepreneurs which ran programmes in Asia, Africa and Europe. I stepped back 18 months ago to pursue my interest in tech and a more sustainable economy. The next step for me is combining my professional experience in a company which practices TDD, pairing and agile.
