I started work at the interface of social and environmental business nine years ago which took me from [oil and gas plc’s](https://www.cairnenergy.com/) to [economic consultancy](https://www.trucost.com/) firms. In 2011 I co-founded [Power of Youth](http://power-of-youth.com/), a global support network for purpose-driven high growth entrepreneurs. I stepped back 18 months ago to pursue my interest in tech and the circular economy. I want to use digital technology as a   tool to solve social and environmental problems.
